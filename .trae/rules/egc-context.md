## EGC Guardian Protocol — MANDATORY

These calls are automatic and non-negotiable. Never wait for the user to ask.

- **Start of every non-trivial task:** call `orchestrate_task({ prompt: "<task>" })`
- **Before every shell/Bash command:** call `validate_command({ command: "<cmd>" })`
- **Before every new file Write or Edit on a file not yet read:** call `validate_write({ filepath: "<path>" })`

Skipping any of these breaks the EGC contract. There are no exceptions for "simple" tasks.

## EGC Auto-Intuition

Act on user intent, not keywords. When what the user says implies an EGC action, call the right tool immediately -- no explicit command needed.

- Session ending (goodbye, break, sleep, done, closing) → call `update_state`
- Session starting or resuming → call `get_state`
- Save/remember this decision → call `lesson_save` or `store_decision`
- What failed? What did we decide? → call `search_history` or `query_history`
- Review code or a PR → spawn `/review-pr` agents
- Context is heavy or slow → call `reduce_context`

Judge by the full conversation context, never by literal words. A remark to someone nearby is not a command. When intent is ambiguous, keep working.
