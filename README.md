## 🧠 Why EGC Exists

AI code assistants often degrade into confusing text files and fragmented commands. **Everything Gemini Code (EGC)** fixes this by wrapping the Gemini AI ecosystem in a strict, observable, and professional engineering architecture. It transforms a standard AI assistant into a **managed team of cognitive workers**, monitored via a real-time dashboard.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

EGC is divided into three primary layers:

1.  **The Cognitive Layer (Agents & Skills)**
    *   **Agents:** The "who". Specialized personas (e.g., `security-reviewer`, `code-architect`) that handle distinct domains.
    *   **Skills:** The "how". Standardized operating procedures (e.g., `django-tdd`, `react-accessibility`) that guide agents to success without hallucinations.
2.  **The Runtime Engine (Orchestrators & Queue)**
    *   **Execution Queue:** Manages task dependencies, preventing race conditions and ensuring deterministic outcomes.
    *   **Memory Mesh:** Context is preserved across sessions. Agents don't forget what was discussed 3 hours ago.
    *   **ModelResolver:** Intelligently selects the best model size (Flash vs. Pro) based on the current workload's token budget and complexity.
3.  **The Control Plane (Dashboard)**
    *   **`egc_dashboard.py`:** A zero-dependency, cross-platform Tkinter GUI that provides a window into the otherwise invisible AI execution loop.

---

## 💻 Full Technology Stack

*   **Core:** Python 3.10+, TypeScript, Bash
*   **Database / State:** SQLite, JSON Registry
*   **Presentation:** Tkinter (GUI), Markdown
*   **AI Providers:** Google Gemini (Primary), Anthropic Claude (Bridge), OpenAI (Bridge)

## 🛠️ Beginner Installation Guide

Welcome! If you have never used Python, Git, or an AI CLI before, this guide is written specifically for you.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

**1. Install Python**
You need Python installed on your computer.
*   **Windows:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **CRITICAL:** Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
*   **macOS:** Install via Homebrew: `brew install python` or download from python.org.
*   **Linux:** Open your terminal and run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip`.

**2. Install Git**
Git downloads the code.
*   Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

**3. Install Gemini CLI**
EGC orchestrates the Gemini CLI. You need Node.js installed to get it.
*   Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   Open your terminal and run: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`

### Phase 2: Project Cloning

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:

```bash
# 1. Download the EGC operating system to your computer
git clone https://github.com/Fmarzochi/everything-gemini.git

# 2. Enter the directory
cd everything-gemini
```

### Phase 3: Virtual Environment (Python Isolation)

**What is a Virtual Environment?**
A virtual environment (`venv`) acts as a dedicated sandbox for EGC. It ensures that the Python packages EGC needs don't interfere with your computer's global system files, and keeps your installation clean and isolated.

**Create and Activate the Environment:**

*   **Linux / macOS:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Base install (Pydantic + dispatcher). Required.
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Optional: add the Gemini SDK (only if you have a GEMINI_API_KEY).
    pip install -e .[gemini]
    # For other providers: pip install -e .[claude] / .[openai] / .[all]
    ```

*   **Windows:**
    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .[gemini]   # optional
    ```

*(Note: When active, you should see `(.venv)` prefixing your terminal prompt.)*

### Phase 4: Node Dependencies (State-Store + Hooks)

EGC's state-store (SQLite) and the hook runtime require a few Node.js packages.
Run this once inside the project root:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs `sql.js`, `ajv`, `argparse`, and `js-yaml` into `node_modules/`.
Without this step, the SQLite state-store and hook validators cannot run.

### Phase 5: Bootstrap State Database

Initialize the local SQLite state-store (idempotent — safe to re-run):

```bash
node scripts/bootstrap-state-db.js
```

This creates `~/.gemini/egc/state.db` and applies all schema migrations.

### Phase 6: First Boot (The Dashboard)

EGC is visual. Ensure your virtual environment is active, then run:

```bash
# Run the Control Plane Dashboard
python3 egc_dashboard.py
```

*Note for Windows users:* If `python3` doesn't work, try `python egc_dashboard.py`.

The EGC Dashboard will open. From here, you can browse every Agent, Skill, Command, and Rule installed on the system, and monitor live execution logs.

---

## 📦 Selective Install (Targets: Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, …)

EGC ships scripted installers that materialize the agents, skills, rules, and hooks
into another harness's config layout (e.g. `.cursor/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.gemini/`).
Profiles and modules are declared in `manifests/install-profiles.json` and
`manifests/install-modules.json`.

```bash
# POSIX
./install.sh --target cursor --dry-run typescript

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\install.ps1 --target cursor --dry-run typescript

# Or via npm (after a clone or global install)
npx egc-install --target cursor typescript
```

See `docs/guides/ANTIGRAVITY-GUIDE.md` for a worked end-to-end example and the
list of supported targets.

---

## 🧪 Python ReAct Bridge

EGC exposes a thin Node-to-Python bridge so the multi-provider ReAct
runtime in `src/llm/` is reachable from the Node ecosystem and from npm.

```bash
# Run a prompt through the Python ReAct runtime (requires a provider key
# such as GEMINI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
# or an Ollama instance at OLLAMA_BASE_URL).
npm run prompt -- -p "Summarise the agents/code-architect.md spec"
```

The bridge propagates `EGC_SESSION_ID` and writes a structured
JSONL trace to `.sessions/execution_log.jsonl` for the dashboard and
for `node scripts/ci/runtime-snapshot.js`.

---

## ⚡ CLI Execution

Once you are comfortable with the Dashboard, you can start using EGC in your terminal.
Ensure you are inside the `everything-gemini` folder.

```bash
# Start the Gemini CLI
gemini
```

Inside the interactive prompt, you can call EGC commands:
*   `/help` - View available commands.
*   `/plan "Build a secure authentication system"` - Triggers the planner agent.
*   `/security-scan` - Triggers the AgentShield security auditor.

---

## 🌐 Cross-Platform Support

EGC is developed and tested primarily on Linux. macOS works without changes. Windows
support is best-effort and depends on which subsystem you use.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Arch) — ✅ Primary target
*   **Execution:** Standard bash or zsh.
*   **UI:** Ensure you have Tkinter installed (`sudo apt install python3-tk`).
*   **Paths:** Native Unix paths `/`.

### macOS — ✅ Supported (Unix-like)
*   **Execution:** zsh (default) or bash.
*   **UI:** macOS includes Tkinter with its standard Python distributions.

### Windows — ⚠️ Best-effort (use WSL or Git Bash)
*   **Recommended:** Run EGC inside WSL2 (Ubuntu) — gives you a real Linux environment.
*   **Native entrypoint:** `install.ps1` is the supported PowerShell installer and is
    covered by the CI matrix on Windows Server (Node 18/20/22). Run it directly
    from PowerShell or Command Prompt.
*   **Alternative:** Git Bash for `install.sh`; Python and Node CLIs work
    from PowerShell/Command Prompt.
*   **Limitation:** The hook pipeline is mostly Node-based, but one POSIX shell
    hook (`*.sh`) is skipped when running outside Git Bash/WSL. Core dashboard
    and CLI commands work fully.
*   **Paths:** EGC normalizes paths internally via Node's `path` module, but
    embedded shell snippets assume a POSIX shell is available.

---

## 🛑 Troubleshooting

**1. The dashboard opens as a blank white/gray screen.**
*   *Fix:* Ensure you are running it exactly as `python3 egc_dashboard.py` from the root of the `everything-gemini` folder. Do not run it from inside another directory.

**2. "gemini: command not found"**
*   *Fix:* You missed installing the Gemini CLI. Run `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`.

**3. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'" (Linux)**
*   *Fix:* Run `sudo apt install python3-tk`.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need an API key?**
A: Yes. You will need a Google Gemini API key configured for the Gemini CLI to execute AI commands.

**Q: Can I use this for non-Python projects?**
A: Absolutely. EGC is written in Python, but the Agents and Skills can write, review, and test code in TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, Swift, and more.

**Q: Is this a replacement for my IDE?**
A: No. EGC runs alongside your IDE (like VS Code or Cursor). It acts as your automated senior engineering team, while you remain the director.

## 📡 Telemetry & Local State

EGC stores all runtime state on your local machine. Nothing is sent
to a third party unless you explicitly call a model provider.

| Surface | Path | Written by | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| Session trace | `.sessions/execution_log.jsonl` | `scripts/runtime/tracer.py` | JSONL (one event per line) |
| Shared state store | `~/.gemini/egc/state.db` | `scripts/lib/state-store/`, `scripts/memory/persistent_memory.py` | SQLite |
| Workflow records | `.sessions/workflows/<workflow_id>.json` | `scripts/workflows/workflow_engine.py` | JSON |
| Install-state per harness | `<target>/egc-install-state.json` | `scripts/install-apply.js` | JSON |

Inspect the live state with:

```bash
node scripts/ci/runtime-snapshot.js          # cross-runtime view
node scripts/ci/runtime-topology.js          # subsystem graph
node scripts/ci/capability-graph.js          # agents/skills/commands graph
```

None of these files are shipped or transmitted. Delete the
`.sessions/` directory at any time to reset local telemetry.
