**A Gemini-first orchestration ecosystem and local-first AI operational environment.**

Everything Gemini Code (EGC) is a multi-harness deployment system and cognitive payload manager. It transforms standard AI assistants into capable, standardized engineering teams by injecting curated skills, agents, and orchestration instructions into your environment. 

EGC excels at organizing, versioning, and deploying complex cognitive workflows into third-party IDEs (Cursor, Codebuddy, Codex) and CLIs. It provides a serious, cross-platform control plane that wraps standard AI models in strict, observable engineering procedures.

### The EGC Control Plane in Action

## 🚀 Get Started

EGC is designed for low-friction onboarding. It installs the knowledge and workflows you need directly into the tools you already use.

### 1. System Requirements
*   **Node.js 18+** (Required for the installer and hook mesh)
*   **Python 3.10+** (Required for the Dashboard UI and test runners)
*   **Git**

### 2. Clone & Initialize
Download the ecosystem and bootstrap the local state store.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fmarzochi/everything-gemini.git
cd everything-gemini

# Install Node dependencies (State-Store & Hooks)
npm install

# Bootstrap the local SQLite state-store (idempotent, safe to run anytime)
node scripts/bootstrap-state-db.js
```

### 3. Launch the Control Plane
The EGC Dashboard is a zero-dependency Tkinter GUI. Use it to explore the massive catalog of 228+ skills and 62+ agents before deploying them.

```bash
# Setup Python Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Dashboard
python3 egc_dashboard.py
```

### 4. Deploy Capabilities to Your Harness
Use the EGC Node installer to deploy skills and agents directly into your preferred IDE or CLI framework (Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, Codebuddy).

```bash
# Example: Install TypeScript skills and core rules into a Cursor project
npm run egc-install -- --target cursor --profile developer typescript
```

### 5. Enable Cognitive Memory (Optional)
To enable long-term persistence and Obsidian integration:

1.  **Configure Environment:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `OBSIDIAN_TOKEN`.
2.  **Initialize Settings:** Copy `egc_settings.json.example` to `egc_settings.json` and set your `vaultPath`.
3.  **Local Context:** EGC will automatically start indexing sessions into your local memory and vault.

## 📊 Ecosystem Inventory & Cross-Tool Parity

EGC ships with a massive, continuously validated catalog of cognitive payloads, ensuring that your AI harness has the right context for the job. Out of the box you get access to 62 agents, 228 skills, and 74 commands, strictly validated by the CI catalog gate (`scripts/ci/catalog.js`).

### Catalog Snapshot

| Surface | Inventory | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Agents** | 62 agents | Specialized personas (e.g., `security-reviewer`) that handle distinct domains. |
| **Skills** | 228 skills | Standardized operating procedures organized in 14 categories. |
| **Commands** | 74 commands | CLI slash-command entrypoints for terminal execution. |
| **Cognitive Memory** | Obsidian + Local | Persistence layer for long-term project knowledge and vault integration. |

### Cross-Harness Parity

How the EGC native inventory compares to the same surfaces in other major AI coding harnesses:

| Surface | Gemini Code (EGC) | Claude Code | Codex CLI | OpenCode |
|---------|------------------:|-------------|-----------|---------:|
| **Agents** | 62 | Shared (AGENTS.md) | Shared (AGENTS.md) | 12 |
| **Commands** | 74 | Shared | Instruction-based | 31 |
| **Skills** | 228 | Shared | 10 (native format) | 37 |

## 🏗️ Architecture & Runtime Truth

EGC is built on a dual-stack architecture: Node.js handles deployment, state, and context ingestion (the "mesh"), while Python provides the visual dashboard, basic provider bridging, and orchestration substrates.

### Runtime Status Matrix

We believe in technical honesty. EGC contains preserved architectural substrates from its ongoing evolution as an orchestration environment. The following matrix distinguishes active production surfaces from experimental or dormant topology layers.

| Layer | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Installer & Manifests** | **ACTIVE** | `manifests/install-modules.json` is the absolute truth for ecosystem deployment. |
| **Node Hook Mesh** | **ACTIVE** | Context injection, session state, and execution hooks via `scripts/hooks/*.js`. |
| **Dashboard UI** | **ACTIVE** | `egc_dashboard.py` proporciona visibilidade do plano de controle e descoberta de inventário. |
| **Cognitive Memory** | **ACTIVE** | `src/llm/memory/` provides local-first persistence with Obsidian and MCP providers. |
| **Provider Bridge** | **ACTIVE** | `src/llm/cli/prompt.py` provides the canonical Python CLI forwarder. |
| **Registry Snapshots** | **DORMANT BUT INTENTIONAL** | `runtime-map.json` is preserved as a legacy/cache surface; discovery gracefully falls back to deep physical disk search. |
| **Execution Orchestrator** | **ORPHAN-BY-TESTS** | Simulated Python event loop preserved for structural topology continuity. |
| **Execution Queue** | **ORPHAN-BY-TESTS** | Python task queues exist primarily as an architectural mockup in tests. |
| **Workflow Engine** | **ORPHAN-BY-TESTS** | Experimental workflow parser kept alive by topology CI constraints. |

## 🧠 Cognitive Infrastructure & Memory Sovereignty

EGC implements a local-first **Cognitive Memory Layer** designed to persist project knowledge, architectural decisions, and session context without cloud dependencies.

 (Git Ignored Layer)                         (Outside Repository)              (Dynamic Injection)
```

### Security & Privacy Model: The "Empty-Push" Architecture

We enforce a strict separation between **OSS Runtime** (shared) and **User Cognition** (private).

*   **Sovereignty:** The runtime code is open source, but your cognition remains local.
*   **Git Isolation:** Sensitive directories (`memory/`, `.sessions/`, `archaeology/`) and databases are hard-coded in `.gitignore`.
*   **Secret Injection:** Tokens and absolute paths are never hardcoded. They are injected at runtime via `.env` (using `${OBSIDIAN_TOKEN}`).
*   **Empty-Push:** Your `git push` remains structurally empty of any private knowledge, notes, or session traces.

## 🌐 Cross-Platform Support

EGC is developed and tested primarily on Linux. macOS works natively. Windows support is comprehensive for the Node.js installation tools, while Python execution is best-effort.

### Linux & macOS — ✅ Primary Target
*   **Execution:** Native Node.js and Bash.
*   **UI:** Requires `python3-tk` installed on Linux; native on macOS.

### Windows — ⚠️ Supported via PowerShell / WSL
*   **Execution:** `install.ps1` runs natively in PowerShell or Command Prompt.
*   **Recommended:** WSL2 (Ubuntu) is recommended for full POSIX hook compatibility.

## 📡 Telemetry & Local State

EGC is fundamentally local-first. **Nothing is transmitted** outside of your explicit requests to AI model providers. No silent telemetry. No cloud databases.

| Surface | Path | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Shared state store | `~/.gemini/egc/state.db` | SQLite |
| Install-state per harness | `<target>/egc-install-state.json` | JSON |
| Session trace | `.sessions/execution_log.jsonl` | JSONL |

You can safely delete `.sessions/` or the state DB at any time to reset your local telemetry.
