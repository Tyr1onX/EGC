# EGC - Extended Global Context

**Your AI remembers your project across sessions and tools.**

</div>

---

## This is what EGC looks like in practice

You open Claude Code on a project you haven't touched in two weeks. Without typing anything:

```
State loaded from egc-memory via ~/.egc/state/Projects--MyApp.md

Context and preferences acknowledged (terse responses).

Ready to pick up the next items:
• Test full install on a clean machine
• Add GEMINI.md with session memory protocol
• Publish v1.0.1 fix to npm after clean install test passes
• Add mcp_server_count to audit.js
```

The AI already knows what you were building, what decisions you made, what failed, and exactly where you stopped. You didn't type anything. You just started working.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/egc-terminal.gif" alt="EGC demo" width="700" />
</div>

After `sh install.sh`, the memory protocol is injected into the global instruction files for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Windsurf, Amp, VS Code Copilot, Zed, Kiro, Trae, and CodeBuddy, so the AI reads state at the start of each session and saves it at the end. For tools where the AI instruction file isn't read automatically (varies by tool version), you may need to add the project's `CLAUDE.md` or equivalent to the session context manually.

---

## The problem

Every AI coding session starts from zero. Close the window and the context is gone. Your stack preferences, the architectural decisions you made last week, the approach that failed after three attempts. Next session you spend the first ten minutes re-explaining ground you already covered.

It gets worse when you switch tools. Move from Cursor to Claude Code and you start over again. The AI doesn't know you. It never did.

---

## How EGC fixes it

One install. Every tool. Permanent memory.

`sh install.sh` detects which AI tools you have installed (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Windsurf, Amp, VS Code Copilot, Zed, Kiro, Trae, CodeBuddy) and registers the MCP servers in all of them. It also runs a cognitive bootstrap that writes the memory protocol into the global instruction files for each tool, so the AI is instructed to call `get_state({})` at the start of every session and `update_state({...})` at the end.

For every supported tool:
- **Open any session** → AI reads your project state → picks up where you left off
- **Close any session** → AI saves decisions, preferences, next steps
- **Switch tools** → same state file → same context → no re-explaining

The memory protocol requires the AI to call `get_state` and `update_state` via the egc-memory MCP tool. The bootstrap injects the instruction; the tool must support MCP to execute it.

The memory lives at `~/.egc/state/` on your machine, not inside any tool. It follows the project, not the IDE.

## Token savings

Rebuilding context from scratch costs ~1,500 tokens per session. EGC's state file delivers the same information in ~200 tokens.

| | Without EGC | With EGC |
|---|---|---|
| Context overhead per session | ~1,500 tokens | ~200 tokens |
| 20 sessions/month | ~$0.08–$0.09 | ~$0.011–$0.012 |
| Time re-explaining context | 10 min/session | 0 |

The money saved is small. The time and interrupted flow are not.

---

## Install with one command

```bash
npm install -g @egchq/egc && egc install
```

Or without installing globally:

```bash
npx @egchq/egc install
```

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Requires [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

[Full installation guide](docs/installation.md) — git clone, manual steps, Windows PowerShell, troubleshooting.

## Prompt library

**479 components included.** Install once to get access to 63 agents, 229 skills, and 76 commands written from real experience, not generated.

| Type | Count | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Agents | 63 agents | Persona and behavior definitions |
| Skills | 229 skills | Domain-specific workflow runbooks |
| Commands | 76 commands | Command definitions and lifecycle hooks |
| Rules | 111 | Constraints and governance directives |

Organized per harness under `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.kiro/`, and four others. Switch tools and the same workflows follow you.

The library is optional — you're asked during install. Skip it and EGC still gives you persistent memory across every tool.

### Cross-harness distribution

| Component | Total | Claude Code | Gemini CLI | Claude Code native |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agents | 63 | Shared (AGENTS.md) | Shared (AGENTS.md) | 12 |
| Commands | 76 | Shared | Instruction-based | 31 |
| Skills | 229 | Shared | 10 (native format) | 37 |

## MCP servers

EGC runs two local MCP servers over stdio.

**egc-memory**: the one you'll use every session

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get_state` | Reads project memory at session start |
| `update_state` | Saves this session's decisions, preferences, and next steps |
| `store_decision` | Persists a decision to SQLite |
| `query_history` | Returns past decisions by timestamp |

**egc-guardian**: runs in the background

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `validate_command` | Blocks shell injection and unsafe binaries |
| `validate_write` | Blocks writes to sensitive paths (`~/.ssh`, `/etc`) |
| `reduce_context` | Deduplicates and trims Markdown payloads |
| `orchestrate_task` | Routes prompts to relevant agents and skills |

---

## CLI

```bash
egc doctor         # verify both servers are built and working
egc status         # show the last 5 decisions in memory
egc install        # install prompt library to a target harness
egc catalog        # list available profiles and components
egc repair         # restore drifted or missing managed files
egc auto-update    # pull latest changes and reinstall managed targets
```

## Architectural consolidation

Earlier versions of EGC explored distributed runtime concepts: FederationManager, ReplayEngine, cognitive orchestration layers, multi-provider dispatching. Those experiments were real explorations, not deception. They helped define what the project actually needed to be.

What the project actually needed was simpler and more useful: persistent memory across sessions, a validation layer, and a prompt library that works in every tool without reconfiguration.

The current runtime reflects that consolidation. Two MCP servers, local SQLite, plain Markdown state files, one install command. Everything else was removed or isolated.

The branch `legacy-runtime` preserves the full historical architecture for anyone who wants to study the evolution.

## Support EGC

EGC solves a problem that no company has solved: **AI memory that persists across sessions, across tools, and across CLIs.**

Close Claude Code and open Cursor. The AI already knows your project. Switch to Codex. Same context. No re-explaining. No lost decisions. No starting from zero.

That's not a feature. It's a shift in how AI-assisted engineering works.

EGC is built by one developer, maintained in the open, and used by people who are done re-explaining context every session. If it saves you time, consider giving back:

- **[Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/AtazrtxJ)** (ask questions, share feedback, meet other users)
- **[Sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/Fmarzochi)** (for GitHub users, any amount)
- **[Donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=fmarzochi%40gmail.com&currency_code=USD)** (no GitHub account needed)
- **Star the repository** (helps other developers find it)
- **Contribute** (agents, skills, commands, bug fixes, docs via [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md))
- **Share** (if EGC changed how you work, tell someone)

Every contribution, financial or otherwise, goes toward keeping this maintained, documented, and free.
