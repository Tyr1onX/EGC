# Changelog

All notable changes to EGC are documented here.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-06-24

### Bug Fixes

- **SessionStart hook no longer crashes on startup**: the install plan now copies `propagate-state.js` and `project-detect.js` into `~/.claude/egc/lib/` alongside the hook script. Both `require()` calls are also wrapped in try/catch so existing installs degrade gracefully until `egc repair` runs.
- **`egc init` opens the browser automatically** after starting the dashboard, and also when the dashboard was already running.
- **ESLint now ignores `.claude/worktrees/` and `dashboard/`** -- eliminates lint CI failures caused by Claude Code agent worktrees being scanned and service-worker browser globals in the dashboard files.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-06-24

### Bug Fixes

- **npm package corrected**: `dashboard/` directory and the `ws` dependency were missing from the v1.1.3 npm tarball. Users who installed v1.1.3 globally and saw `EGC Dashboard not found. Expected: .../dashboard/server.js` should run `npm install -g @egchq/egc` to get the fix.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-24

### New Features

- **EGC Dashboard** (`egc dashboard`): real-time Mission Control panel at `http://localhost:7890`. Shows live tool calls, file edits, shell commands, token usage, memory state, and agent status as your AI works. Auto-starts after `egc init`. Runs as a background WebSocket server; stop with `egc dashboard stop` and check status with `egc dashboard status`.
- **IDE hook emitters**: Cursor, Kiro, and OpenCode now emit structured hook events to the dashboard over WebSocket. Tool calls, file writes, and shell commands appear in real time in the Mission Control panel.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed OpenAI tool serialization: `parameters` is now always emitted as an object, preventing schema validation errors with strict OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Fixed async `ReActAgent` iteration: the agent loop now correctly awaits each tool call result before continuing.
- Fixed stale `X-Title` header in the OpenRouter provider: the header is now derived from the live session title instead of a startup-time snapshot.
- Fixed `GeminiProvider` null content crash: provider now skips `null` content parts instead of throwing on `.text` access.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-20

### New Features

- **`egc watch`**: bidirectional sync daemon. Watches all EGC-managed tool config files in the project. When context is edited directly in any tool file (Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, etc.), the change is extracted from the EGC block and synced to all other tools and back to `~/.egc/state/` automatically. Handles atomic saves (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf rename-based writes) and Windows EPERM events.
- **`auto_learn`**: new `egc-guardian` MCP tool. Mines session failures from hook event history, identifies recurring errors, and reinforces actionable lessons automatically so they are available to the AI on the next session.

### Memory Improvements

- **`update_state` propagates to 11 tool config files**: calling `update_state` now writes the new context to every EGC-managed file found in the project: `.cursor/rules/egc-context.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurf/rules/egc-context.md`, `.trae/rules/egc-context.md`, `.rules` (Zed), `.clinerules` (Cline), `CONVENTIONS.md` (Aider), `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, and `llms.txt`. One call keeps every tool in sync.
- **Natural language interface triggers** added to the EGC block in all propagated files. AI tools that read the block now understand natural language phrases ("remember this", "save to memory", etc.) as EGC tool invocations.

### Guardian Pipeline

- **CacheAligner**: normalizes repeated context blocks before compression to reduce redundancy.
- **ContentRouter**: detects payload type and routes to the appropriate compressor.
- **SmartCrusher**: deduplicates JSON arrays structurally, preserving semantic meaning while cutting token count.
- **Headroom Phase 2**: optional deep compression pass for large payloads that exceed the primary budget.
- All modules are wired into `reduce_context` transparently.

### Infrastructure

- **sql.js replaces better-sqlite3**: the state store now uses a pure-JavaScript/WebAssembly SQLite build. No native compilation, no node-gyp, no build tools required. Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and Alpine out of the box.
- **GitLab CI and mirror**: full pipeline with lint and tests on Node 20/22, mirroring automatically from GitHub. Pinned actions and workflow-level `permissions: {}` for security.
- **Code of Conduct**: Contributor Covenant added. All contributors and community members are expected to follow it.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `update_state` propagation to GitHub Copilot: guard now correctly detects the existing EGC block before inserting.
- Fixed multi-line Context section replacement in bidirectional sync merge.
- Fixed state file path resolution in detached HEAD / non-git directories.
- Fixed `StateWatcher.start()` to return the count of successfully attached watchers rather than the count of discovered files.
- Fixed `egc doctor` to remove stale `better-sqlite3` references after the sql.js migration.
- Pinned `undici` to 6.27.0 in both MCP servers, patching a known CVE.
- Fixed session start hook: the AI had no way to know which agents applied to each project. Session start now detects the project stack and emits a briefing with relevant agents at the start of every session, closing the gap between what EGC promised and what it actually delivered.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-19

### New Tools

- **`lesson_recall`** upgraded to BM25 full-text search via FTS5 virtual table. Searching for related lessons now ranks results by relevance instead of doing plain substring matching. Existing lessons are backfilled on first startup.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed state DB path: `state-db-writer.js`, `runtime-snapshot.js`, and `detect_patterns` now resolve the path via `getEGCDir()` instead of hardcoding `~/.gemini`. Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code users whose memory pipeline was silently broken are now fixed.
- Fixed hook commands to use `process.execPath` instead of bare `node`, eliminating PATH resolution failures with nvm, mise, fnm, and GUI app launchers.
- Fixed `egc init` to warn clearly when `better-sqlite3` native module is unavailable; `egc doctor` also reports missing `state.db`.
- Fixed `detect_patterns` to probe known harness locations for `state.db` instead of hardcoding `~/.gemini`.

### New Models (community contribution by [@muhammadhasnain3031](https://github.com/muhammadhasnain3031))

- Added 7 OpenRouter model mappings to `ModelResolver`: DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek Chat V3, Qwen3 235B, Qwen3 32B, Llama 4 Maverick, Llama 4 Scout, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct. Each entry includes capability metadata, fallback chains, context window, vision and tool support flags.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### New Tools

- **`compress_observations`** - Compresses raw hook observations into structured typed summaries (`tool_failure`, `tool_success`, `file_edit`, etc.) using rule-based analysis. Reduces token usage when injecting observation history into new sessions. Contributed by [@Kunall7890](https://github.com/Kunall7890).

- **`detect_patterns`** - Analyzes runtime events from the state-store database to surface repeated commands and recurring errors across sessions. Helps identify automation candidates and structural issues that persist between conversations.

- **`working_memory`** - Stores transient context within a session with configurable TTL. Entries expire automatically so the memory store does not accumulate stale data across sessions. Exposed as `working_memory_set`, `working_memory_get`, and `working_memory_list`.

- **`lessons`** - Records cross-session knowledge with confidence decay. Each lesson tracks how many times it was reinforced and when it was last seen; confidence degrades over time so stale lessons surface for review rather than being applied forever. Exposed as `lesson_save`, `lesson_recall`, and `lesson_reinforce`.

- **`search_history`** - Full-text search over stored observations using FTS5 with BM25 ranking. Returns results ordered by relevance rather than recency.

### Memory Improvements

- **Branch-aware project state** - `get_state` and `update_state` scope memory per git branch. Switching branches restores the context for that branch automatically.

- **State consolidation pipeline** - A rule-based layering pipeline compresses and consolidates observations on each `update_state` call, keeping the memory store compact without losing important signals.

- **Deterministic SessionStart hook** - The SessionStart hook that writes context into the active harness settings file now runs idempotently. Re-running install or switching adapters does not duplicate entries.

### Infrastructure

- Upgraded CI matrix to Node 20/22/24; dropped Node 18 (EOL).
- Added Windows bun and yarn test jobs.
- SonarCloud AutoScan enabled; all Reliability D and Security Hotspot issues resolved.
- CodeQL Advanced scanning added.
- Dependency Review workflow added for supply chain visibility.

## [1.0.8] - 2024-12-XX

- Initial public release with `npx @egchq/egc` install flow.
- ChatMCP catalog entry (`egc@egc`).
- OIDC Trusted Publishing for npm.
- SessionStart and PreCompact hooks for Claude Code.
