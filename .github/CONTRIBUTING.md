# Contributing to EGC - Extended Global Context

Welcome to the engineering governance guide for **Extended Global Context (EGC)**. This is not just a collection of prompts or scripts; it is a cross-platform AI operating system and runtime orchestration fabric.

Because EGC operates as a structured engineering platform, contributions must align with our core architecture, ensuring the stability, observability, and deterministic execution of the cognitive ecosystem.

## Governance Philosophy

EGC operates under a philosophy of **Stability over Expansion** and **Passive Maintenance**.

1. **Runtime Hardening:** EGC is a production-grade orchestration engine. We prioritize making the existing system more resilient over adding unstructured novelty.
2. **Passive Maintenance:** EGC is designed to require minimal upkeep. Contributions must not introduce brittle dependencies, external APIs that frequently break, or obscure hacks.
3. **Cross-Platform Integrity:** EGC supports Linux, Windows, and macOS. Contributions, especially to install scripts and hooks, must validate safely across these environments without platform-specific hardcoding.
4. **Runtime Protection:** The core engine (Execution Queue, ModelResolver, JSON Registry) is locked down. Changes to the orchestration layer require exponentially higher validation standards than adding a new skill.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the EGC OS
gh repo fork Fmarzochi/EGC --clone
cd EGC

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/my-contribution

# 3. Add your contribution following the architectural standards below

# 4. Verify locally
sh install.sh && egc doctor

# 5. Submit PR
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add my-feature" && git push -u origin feat/my-contribution
```

## Orchestrators & Runtime Core

While adding Agents and Skills is the most common contribution, EGC's true power lies in its **Runtime Ecosystem**: Orchestrators, the Execution Queue, and the Registry.

If you are proposing changes to `scripts/`, `src/llm/`, or the underlying orchestrator logic:
- **Execution Queue Stability:** Modifications must not introduce race conditions or break the deterministic sequencing of agent tasks.
- **Runtime-Map Integrity:** EGC uses a JSON registry (`registry/runtime-map.json`) to link the cognitive layer to the physical filesystem. Any new core capability must map correctly to the registry.
- **Registry Synchronization:** Ensure that the catalog and CI validators can still parse the registry after your modifications.
- **Orchestration Layer Modifications:** These are strictly reviewed. If you add a new orchestrator (e.g., a new DAG parser or parallel execution loop), it must include fallback safety mechanisms and graceful degradation if a task fails.

## Contributing Skills

Skills are standardized operating procedures that the EGC Runtime loads based on context.

### Directory Structure

```
skills/
└── your-skill-name/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description used for auto-activation.
origin: EGC

## When to Activate

Describe scenarios where the EGC orchestrator should load this skill into the context window.

## Core Concepts

Explain key patterns and guidelines.

## Code Examples

\`\`\`typescript
// Include practical, tested examples
function example() {
  // Well-commented code
}
\`\`\`

## Anti-Patterns

Show what NOT to do with examples.

## Best Practices

```

### Skill Categories

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Language Standards** | Idioms, conventions, best practices | `python-patterns`, `golang-patterns` |
| **Framework Patterns** | Framework-specific guidance | `django-patterns`, `nextjs-patterns` |
| **Workflow** | Step-by-step processes | `tdd-workflow`, `refactoring-workflow` |
| **Domain Knowledge** | Specialized domains | `security-review`, `api-design` |
| **Tool Integration** | Tool/library usage | `docker-patterns`, `supabase-patterns` |

### Skill Adaptation Policy

If porting an idea from another system:
- Copy the underlying logic, not the external product identity.
- Rename the skill when EGC materially changes or expands the surface.
- Prefer EGC-native rules and skills over unvetted third-party npm/pip dependencies.

### Skill Checklist

- [ ] Focused on one domain/technology.
- [ ] Includes "When to Activate" section.
- [ ] Includes practical, copy-pasteable code examples.
- [ ] Shows anti-patterns.
- [ ] Under 500 lines (800 max).
- [ ] Tested via the EGC CLI.
- [ ] No sensitive data (API keys, paths).

## Contributing Agents

Agents are specialized cognitive workers invoked by the EGC orchestration engine to handle specific tasks.

### File Location

```
agents/your-agent-name.md
```

### Agent Template

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: What this agent does and when the orchestrator should invoke it. Be specific!
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep", "Glob"]
model: gemini-2.5-pro
---

You are a [role] specialist operating within the EGC runtime.

## Your Role

- Primary responsibility
- Secondary responsibility
- What you DO NOT do (boundaries)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand
How you approach the task using EGC tools.

### Step 2: Execute
How you perform the work.

### Step 3: Verify
How you validate results before returning control to the orchestrator.

## Output Format

What you return to the runtime queue or user.
```

### Agent Fields

| Field | Description | Options |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | Lowercase, hyphenated | `code-reviewer` |
| `description` | Used for routing decisions | Be specific! |
| `tools` | Only what's needed | `Read`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Task` (for delegation) |
| `model` | Capability target | `gemini-1.5-flash` (fast), `gemini-2.5-pro` (complex) |

---

## Contributing Hooks

Hooks are automatic interceptors triggered by lifecycle events within the EGC runtime.

### File Location

```
hooks/hooks.json
```

### Hook Types

| Type | Trigger | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before an agent tool executes | Validate, warn, or block destructive actions |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool runs | Format code, audit outputs, notify systems |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | Load project memory, initialize connections |
| `Stop` | Session ends | Cleanup artifacts, write session summaries |

### Hook Format

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "tool == \"Bash\" && tool_input.command matches \"rm -rf /\"",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '[EGC Hook] BLOCKED: Destructive command intercepted.' && exit 1"
          }
        ],
        "description": "Block dangerous rm commands at the runtime level"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hook Checklist

- [ ] Matcher is extremely specific.
- [ ] Includes clear error/info messages identifying it as an `[EGC Hook]`.
- [ ] Uses correct exit codes (`exit 1` strictly blocks execution).
- [ ] Tested extensively locally to ensure it doesn't break normal workflows.

## Dependencies

### How Dependencies Are Selected

EGC selects dependencies based on:

1. **Necessity** — a dependency is only added if it provides functionality that cannot reasonably be implemented in-project without significant maintenance cost
2. **License compatibility** — must be MIT, ISC, BSD, Apache-2.0, or equivalent permissive license
3. **Maintenance status** — preferred packages must have active maintenance and a responsive security process

### Obtaining Dependencies

Dependencies are obtained exclusively through npm. All dependencies are listed in `package.json` and locked in `package-lock.json`. To install:

```bash
npm ci
```

This installs the exact versions from the lock file, ensuring reproducible builds.

### Tracking Dependencies

- Dependabot is configured to automatically open PRs for outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- `npm audit` runs on every CI build and fails on high/critical severity findings
- The `dependency-review.yml` workflow blocks PRs that introduce new high-severity dependencies
- SCA policy details are documented at `docs/security/SCA-POLICY.md`

---

## Build Instructions

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm (bundled with Node.js) or yarn or bun

### Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build MCP servers (TypeScript -> JavaScript)
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

The MCP servers (`egc-guardian`, `egc-memory`) are TypeScript projects compiled with `tsc`. Build output goes to `dist/` inside each server directory.

See the [installation guide](docs/installation/) for platform-specific instructions.
